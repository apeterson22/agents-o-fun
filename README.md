## Overview

*Agents-o-Fun* is an **open-source framework** designed to make AI agent development accessible and enjoyable. Imagine agents that can chat, analyze content, or even collaborate—all with a dash of personality! Built with flexibility in mind, this repo leverages modern tools to help you create agents for practical tasks or just for fun.

**Why use it?** Because AI doesn’t have to be boring! Whether you’re a hobbyist or a pro, this project is your sandbox for agent-based experimentation.

---

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Build agents with reusable, customizable components.
- *Multi-Agent Magic*: Run several agents at once and watch them interact.
- **External Tools**: Connect to web searches, X posts, or user-uploaded files (images, PDFs, etc.).
- *Ready-Made Fun*: Try out pre-built agents with playful examples.
- **Extensibility**: Add your own tools, APIs, or data sources easily.

---

## Prerequisites

Before jumping in, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.8+**: The heart of this project.
- *Git*: To clone and manage the repo.
- **pip**: For installing dependencies (comes with Python).
- *Virtualenv* (optional): Keep your setup clean.
- **API Keys** (if needed): For external services like X or web search—see [Configuration](#configuration).

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Get the code onto your machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/apeterson22/agents-o-fun.git
   cd agents-o-fun
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** *(Recommended)*  
   Keep dependencies isolated:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Grab the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *No `requirements.txt`? Check [Project Structure](#project-structure) for manual setup.*

4. **Test It Out**  
   Confirm everything works:
   ```bash
   python -m agents_o_fun --help
   ```
   *Adjust the command if the entry point differs.*

## Usage

### Quick Start

Launch an agent in just a few steps:

1. **Run a Sample Agent**  
   ```bash
   python examples/simple_agent.py
   ```
   This starts a basic agent ready to chat. Type something like *“Hello!”* and see what happens!

2. **Play Around**  
   - Ask it fun questions: *“Tell me a story!”*  
   - Test its limits: *“What’s 42 + 42?”*

### Configuration

Tweak your agents with a config file (e.g., `config.yaml`):

- **API Keys**  
   Add credentials for external services:
   ```yaml
   api_keys:
     x_api: "your_x_api_key_here"
     search_api: "your_search_api_key_here"
   ```

- **Agent Settings**  
   Define personalities or tools:
   ```yaml
   agents:
     fun_bot:
       personality: "cheeky"
       tools: ["web_search", "x_analyzer"]
   ```

Run with your config:
```bash
python -m agents_o_fun --config config.yaml
```

### Running Examples

Dive into the `examples/` folder for inspiration:

- **`chatty_agent.py`**: Analyzes X posts and responds.
- *`image_agent.py`*: Describes images (asks for confirmation before generating).
- **`multi_agent.py`**: Multiple agents working together.

Try one out:
```bash
python examples/multi_agent.py
```
